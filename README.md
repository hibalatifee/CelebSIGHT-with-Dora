## Want to make your own AI app?
Check out [Replicate](https://replicate.com). We make it easy to run machine learning models with an API.

## Setup

Clone this repo, and setup and activate a virtualenv:

```bash
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
python3 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Then, install the dependencies:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Make a [Replicate](https://replicate.com), [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/), and [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) account and set your tokens:

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<token>
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=<eleven-token>
```

Make a new voice in Eleven and get the voice id of that voice using their [get voices](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/voices) API, or by clicking the flask icon next to the voice in the VoiceLab tab.

```
export ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=<voice-id>
```

## Run it!

In on terminal, run the webcam capture:
```bash
python capture.py
```
In another terminal, run the narrator:

```bash
python narrator.py
```

### Hiba's notes for CelebSIGHT
Would need access to OpenAI API key and Eleven Labs (paid subscription) for running this. No need to make a .env file for this, you can paste the OpenAI and ElevenLabs API keys into the terminal before running narrator.py. Also, this runs with Python 3.10 version. Run this with Streamlit (Streamlit run narrator.py). Will need to run capture.py first when running this program. Open this repo in Visual Studio Code. Rest stays the same as above.
